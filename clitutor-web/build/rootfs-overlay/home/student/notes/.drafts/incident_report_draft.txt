Subject: Suspected Brute-Force SSH Attack on shore-hq

Timeline:
  0427 UTC - Multiple failed SSH login attempts detected from 203.0.113.45
  0427 UTC - Targeted users: root, admin, test, guest, oracle
  0427 UTC - 7 failed attempts in 18 seconds (automated attack pattern)
  0600 UTC - Legitimate login from monitoring station (10.0.100.5)
  0942 UTC - Second attack wave from different IP: 198.51.100.77
  0942 UTC - Targeted users: root, postgres

Analysis:
  - Attack source IPs are in documentation ranges (203.0.113.0/24, 198.51.100.0/24)
  - Common username dictionary pattern (root, admin, test, guest, oracle, postgres)
  - Rapid succession suggests automated tool (hydra, medusa, or similar)
  - No successful compromises detected

Recommendations:
  1. Implement fail2ban to block IPs after 3 failed attempts
  2. Disable password authentication; require SSH keys only
  3. Consider moving SSH to non-standard port
  4. Add source IP to firewall block list
